         <h1>Prelude to the following story.</h1>

         <section>
            <p>A few years ago, I wrote this down within one of my social media accounts.  This was not a creative writing exercise but more of a flash dream that I had and has stuck with me for a long time since.</p>
            <p>I have not additional thoughts on this more than what is written down below.  And yes, I know that there are some liberties that are made that do not fit the historical record based on the photos that I have added here.</p>
            <p>This is just something that I felt that I should write down for whatever reason and that has calmed this down in the intervening years.</p>
            <p>Please do understand that the story is graphic and symbolic in nature.  This is not meant to be a pleasant read but to illusrate the story that was painted within my mind.</p>

         <h2>Just something that I felt compelled to write down... Don't know why...</h2>
   
         <section>
            <p>I awake to a light shining in my eyes...</p>
            <p>The light has a coppery tone to it through my eyelids.  But when I open my eyes, it is like a thousand flashbulbs have went off in front of my face.</p>
            <p>It takes a minute or two for my eyes to adjust to the light and I finally see the noon day sun wafting through tiny holes in the ceiling above me.  The ceiling has an odd familiarity to it, like I had seen it somewhere else before.</p>
            <p>But the holes are what concerns me more and more as I adjust to my surroundings. Each of the holes have ragged edges like an ice pick has been rammed repeatedly through the roof.  Some of the holes are round and others are elongated like a coin slot.  Others are somewhere in between.</p>
            <p>Finally, I feel the thrumming of engines through my back.  Not just one engine but many straining at their limit, clawing forward one revolution at a time.</p>

         <section>
            <p>My nose starts to smell the familiar odor of expended gunpowder and cordite.  My skin on my forehead has a odd combination of feeling slick, sticky and clammy all at the same time.</p>
            <p>I start looking around and see the ceiling does not come to and abrupt corner but gently arcs into the wall where I see the large opening with the machine gun sticking out of it into a brilliant blue sky.  Next to that, I see a body slumped down beside the gun.</p> 
            <p>It strikes me as funny for a moment that it looks like a department store mannequin since the body is just there up to the neck.  Then my addled brain realizes that the body is just that...</p>

         <h3>
            <p>a dead body.</p>
         </h3>

         <section>
            <p>I try to sit up and feel the pain shooting through my leg.  I glance down and see the shrapnel sticking out of it about four or five inches below my left knee.</p>
            <p>I reach down and pull it out slowly since it feels like an eternity in doing so. Finally, it comes loose and the blood starts oozing slowly into the material of my pants and overalls.</p>
            <p>I grab an ammo can and pull myself up into a sitting position.  Finally, the full scope of the situation comes into focus.  It appears that pieces of an explosive shell came through the side of the plane and hit my friend square in the head and peppered the entire aft fuselage of this crate that we are all in.</p>
            <p>I hear the screaming of the pilot and co-pilot over the headphones telling us the directions that the enemy continues to dog us from.  Slowly, I get up and get back onto my gun to try and shoot down the bastards that have been attacking us since we left our base.</p>
            <p>On the next craft that comes by I see the all too familiar starred emblem painted across their wings.  I rack a fresh round into the chamber of the gun and let loose with a short burst of fire toward this other being that wants to kill me as much as I want to kill it.</p>
            <p>We both open up about the same time and both are right on our targets.  Just before I feel the shells hitting me, I see the head of the other pilot explode within the canopy of his craft.  The craft immediately pulls to the left towards the green tinged sea below.</p>
            <p>With my last few breaths, I know that I have done my duty and have fallen victorious in the field of battle.
